# Diabetes Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on health parameters. By utilizing machine learning models, it provides insights into potential diabetes risks and assists in early diagnosis.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Machine learning model development
- Model evaluation and optimization

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes various medical parameters such as:

- **Age**
- **Blood Pressure**
- **Glucose Levels**
- **BMI**
- **Insulin Levels**
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**

## 📊 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost

## 🔥 Results

The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC score. The best-performing model provides reliable predictions for diabetes risk.
